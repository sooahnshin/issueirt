\arguments{
\item{ideal}{An ideal object (output of \code{pscl::ideal}).}

\item{rollcall}{A roll call object (output of \code{pscl::rollcall}; yea_code = 1, nay_code = 0).}

\item{pol_rc1}{A character representing the roll call ID for the most polarized bill in the horizontal dimension.}

\item{pol_rc2}{A character representing the roll call ID for the most polarized bill in the vertical dimension (optional).}

\item{party_code_col}{A character specifying the column name for party code.}

\item{left_party_code}{A party code for the party that should be on the left of the horizontal dimension.}

\item{top_party_code}{A party code for the party that should be on top of the vertical dimension (optional).}

\item{top_perc}{The percentage of legislators to be included based on their total number of votes cast.}

\item{x2_threshold}{The threshold for the vertical dimension for the first constraint.}

\item{as_list}{Boolean indicating whether to return the constraints as a list (default is FALSE).}
}
\value{
A tibble or list of legislator IDs along with their x1 and x2 coordinates based on the constraints.

\description{
This function identifies constraints in legislative voting data based on polarization,
