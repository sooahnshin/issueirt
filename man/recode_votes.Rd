\arguments{
\item{votes}{A matrix of votes (output of \code{pscl::rollcall(...)$votes}; recommended to use \code{filter_votes} first).}

\item{liberal_code}{Party code for the liberal party (default: 100).}

\item{conservative_code}{Party code for the conservative party (default: 200).}

\item{yea}{A vector of values in \code{votes} that are coded as yea (default: 1).}

\item{nay}{A vector of values in \code{votes} that are coded as nay (default: 0).}

\item{missing}{A vector of values in \code{votes} that are coded as missing (default: c(NA, 2)).}

\item{na_threshold}{The maximum ratio of missing data for a bill to be recoded (default: 0.5).}
